body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}

Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0:
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0; <----
}

As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org:
  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <form action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org'> </form><----
  </body>


Seeing as we plan on having three distinct sections to the form, add three fieldset elements within the form:
<body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <form action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org'>
        <fieldset></fieldset>
        <fieldset></fieldset>
        <fieldset></fieldset>
    </form>
  </body>

You can add minlength attribute to define min. Length of the password:
<label>Create a New Password: <input type="password" minlength="8" required /></label>

With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}:
<label>Create a New Password: <input type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required /></label>


You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time.
   <fieldset>
      <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Personal Account</label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Business Account</label>
      <label><input type="checkbox" required /> I accept the terms and conditions</label>
   </fieldset>
